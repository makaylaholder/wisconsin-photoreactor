# Analog Driver Board

A simple photoreactor driver board providing control over light intensity. This control is achieved through adjustment of the board-mounted potentiometer. No software is required, and multiple WPP reactors fitted with this board can be connected in series to a single power source. However, fan speed isnâ€™t adjustable and is maintained at maximum.

Relative light intensity can be determined using the analog driver board test points and a multimeter. See operation instructions for more information.

The analog driver board is the recommended driver solution for a typical user.

All prices are extended estimates in USD.
In general, these are overestimates, so this should be an upper-estimate on cost.
Many of these components can be substituted, so take the above as suggestions.
Boards themselves can be printed for approximately $5 each.
